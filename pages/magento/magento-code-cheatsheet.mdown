summary: The best way to access and manipulate data in Magento is by using the `Mage` object's functions. For example: `getModel()` and `getHelper()`.

## Magento Database Models

The best way to access and manipulate data in Magento is by using the provided objects and their associated functionality..
For example, you can get a Magento category model like this:

	:::php
	$model_category = Mage::getModel('catalog/category');

With your category model you now retrieve data
e.g. get all child categories of category ID 2 and echo the name

	:::php
	$model_category = Mage::getModel('catalog/category');
	foreach ($model_category->getCategories($id=2) as $category) {
		echo $category->getName();
	}
	
Refer to the API documentation to see what methods are available.

## Magento Helper Classes

Magento has helper classes which are pretty handy also.
For example, you can get a Magento category helper like this:

	:::php
	$helper = Mage::helper('catalog/category');

Your helper will have a bunch of methods defined for performing common tasks.
For example, you can get all your stores top level categories as follows:

	:::php
	$helper = Mage::helper('catalog/category');
	foreach ($helper->getStoreCategories() as $category) {
		echo $category->getName();
	}

Check this file to see what methods are available in the catalog category helper:
