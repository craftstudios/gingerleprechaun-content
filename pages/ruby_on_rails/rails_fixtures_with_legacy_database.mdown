summary: The fixture file has to be TABLENAME.yml (not case sensitive)

# Rails Fixtures with Legacy Database

My setup was:

MySQL Table name: `TABLENAME` (all caps)  
Rails Model name: `TableName` (camel case)

1. The fixture file has to be `TABLENAME.yml` (not case sensitive)
2. `fixtures()` takes the symbol name of the Model, in this case `:tableName` (note the first lowercase letter) This is the bit that drove me mad - i was writing fixtures `:TableName` which appeared to work, but then the test failed if I tried `TableName(:foo)`
3. Now you can write `tableName(:foo)`
