# Hide 'All Mail' from GMail

If like me you prefer to use your desktop mail app for accessing your GMail account, you're probably sick of imap syncing with the 'All Mail' folder all the time.

To hide the 'All Mail' folder, go to `Settings>Labs` and add the 'Advanced IMAP Controls widget'.

Now you can go to `Settings>Labels` and untick `Show in IMAP` for 'All Mail' and 'Starred'. (Email you mark as 'Flagged' in your desktop client will show up in the 'Starred' folder in Web GMail)
