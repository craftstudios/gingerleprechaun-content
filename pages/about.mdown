# A little bit about me

Hi, Iâ€™m Barry - a freelance web developer, originally from Ireland. I called Edinburgh home for a long time and miss it still, but now live in sunny Nelson, New Zealand.

I deliver fun fresh design, build sites with the latest technology, and care about my work. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/keenytn1) or view my [full CV on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/barrykeenan).

I'm rediscovering [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) after being away from it for years... and rediscovering blogging in general. Basically this is where I keep notes for my my own reference, but others may find it useful too.

I like climbing, snowboarding, good wine, good food, and [good music](http://www.last.fm/user/craftstudios).

Baz :)
