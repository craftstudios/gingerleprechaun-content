# Association Callbacks

Similar to the normal callbacks that hook into the lifecycle of an Active Record object, you can also define callbacks that get trigged when you add an object to or remove an object from a association collection. Example:

	class Project
		has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, :after_add => :evaluate_velocity

		def evaluate_velocity(developer)
			...
		end
	end

It’s possible to stack callbacks by passing them as an array.

Possible callbacks are: `before_add`, `after_add`, `before_remove` and `after_remove`.

Should any of the `before_add` callbacks throw an exception, the object does not get added to the collection. Same with the `before_remove` callbacks, if an exception is thrown the object doesn’t get removed.

_Note: These callbacks belong in in the model on which you call update_attribute in the HABTM relationship, not for its partner model._
