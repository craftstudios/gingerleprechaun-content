summary: Ok, I've just got back from [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/). It was awesome to be amongst so many bright motivated people. The talks gave a broad overview on what was happening in the ruby community and the workshops explored specific topics in more technical depth.

Ok, I've just got back from [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/). It was awesome to be amongst so many bright motivated people. The talks gave a broad overview on what was happening in the ruby community and the workshops explored specific topics in more technical depth.

For now, [here's where you can find most of the slides from the conference](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/wiki/railsconf2007/index.cgi?PresentationSlides).
