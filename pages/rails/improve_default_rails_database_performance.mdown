summary: Active Record (AR) is slow. All that nice reflection comes at a price. You should use AR to prototype your app, then take a look at the logs to see where SQL can be tweaked.

# Improve Default Rails Database Performance
============================================

Active Record (AR) is slow. All that nice reflection comes at a price. You should use AR to prototype your app, then take a look at the logs.

1. Sort your development log.

If a database query is only run a few times, let AR handle it. If one is being run a 1000 times then we should pull it out and tweak it.

2. Pull the SQL from the log

Rails has already done the hard work for us, right?

3. Tweak the SQL

For example:

Stick the tweaked DB query into your model using `find_by_sql()` and things should move along nicely...
