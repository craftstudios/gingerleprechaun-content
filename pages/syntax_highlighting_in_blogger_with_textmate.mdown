# Syntax Highlighting in blogger with textmate
==============================================

Eventually (in the far distant future) I want to set up my own server to host rails apps on and perhaps a blog driven by [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/) - particularly cause you can get good syntax highlighting plugins for it.

In the meantime, I discovered that you can [export your current highlighting theme from textmate as CSS](http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2006/07/13/highlight-me-baby/), using the bundle command `'Create CSS From Current Theme'` (vaguely enough ;) ). Then any time I want to post code snippets here, I use the similarly vague command `'Create HTML From Document'`

All you need to do is copy and paste the CSS into your Blogger template.

Beautiful.
